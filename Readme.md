## **Usage of GitHub Copilot:**


GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code suggestion tool that assists developers in writing code by providing intelligent suggestions and autocompletions. In the Expense Tracker - Budget Buddy project, you can leverage GitHub Copilot in the following scenarios:

Code Generation: GitHub Copilot can generate boilerplate code for common tasks, such as form validation, input sanitization, or API request handling. It can save time by automatically generating code snippets based on the context and desired functionality.

Syntax and Method Suggestions: When working with complex JavaScript operations or functions, GitHub Copilot can offer suggestions for correct syntax and recommend suitable methods to achieve specific tasks. This can be particularly useful when dealing with data manipulation, date/time calculations, or mathematical operations.

Error Handling: GitHub Copilot can help identify potential errors or bugs in your code by suggesting fixes or pointing out possible issues. It can provide insights into syntax errors, incorrect variable assignments, or missing function calls, assisting in debugging and improving code quality.

## **Challenges Faced:**
User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that effectively presents financial information and allows seamless interaction was a significant challenge. Balancing aesthetics with functionality and ensuring a responsive design for various screen sizes required careful consideration and iterative design improvements.

Performance Optimization: Managing large datasets and ensuring smooth performance while handling extensive expense records and budget calculations was a challenge. Optimizing database queries, implementing caching strategies, and employing efficient algorithms for data retrieval and calculations were necessary to provide a seamless user experience.
